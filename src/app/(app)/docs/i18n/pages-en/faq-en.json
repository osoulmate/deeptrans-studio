            "question": "What are the minimum system requirements?",
            "solution": "Minimum requirements: Node.js ≥ 18.18, Docker and Docker Compose (for dependency services), at least 4GB RAM.\nRecommended configuration: 8GB+ RAM, multi-core CPU for better performance."
          },
          {
            "question": "Is Docker required?",
            "solution": "Development environment recommends using Docker Compose to run dependency services (PostgreSQL, Redis, Milvus, etc.), but Next.js application and Worker can run locally. Production environment recommends using Docker for deployment."

          {
            "question": "Where should environment variables be placed?",
            "solution": "Development environment uses .env.local file, production environment uses .env or .env.production. Ensure these files are added to .gitignore and do not commit sensitive information to version control."

          {
            "question": "How does translation memory work?",
            "solution": "Translation memory uses Milvus vector database to store source-target text pairs. During translation, the system searches for similar translation references through hybrid search (vector retrieval + keyword matching)."

          {
            "question": "How to import terminology dictionary?",
            "solution": "Supports batch import in CSV, Excel, and other formats. In dictionary management page, select import function, upload file and map fields."
